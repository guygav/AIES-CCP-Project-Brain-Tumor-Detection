## Introduction

Brain tumors are a significant health concern, affecting thousands of people worldwide. Early detection can greatly improve treatment outcomes. This project leverages the power of deep learning to analyze MRI images and identify potential tumors. By using CNN and VGG19, we aim to provide a robust solution that can assist in medical imaging diagnostics.

## Features

- **MRI Image Analysis**: The model can analyze MRI scans to detect tumors.
- **User Interface**: A Streamlit-based interface allows users to upload images and view results easily.
- **High Accuracy**: The use of transfer learning with VGG19 enhances detection accuracy.
- **Open Source**: This project is open for contributions and improvements.

## Technologies Used

- **AI in Healthcare**: Utilizing artificial intelligence to improve health outcomes.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: A deep learning technique for image classification.
- **VGG19**: A popular CNN architecture known for its performance in image recognition tasks.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building web applications for machine learning projects.
